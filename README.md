Project Title
Radiation Classification

Description
This project focuses on building and evaluating machine learning models for classifying radiation levels. The goal is to accurately categorize radiation/irradiance based on input features.
The dataset used for this project is the ICRISAT Weather 1978 to 2018 dataset.
Radiation_classification.ipynb: The main Jupyter notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and visualization.

Project Title
Wine Quality Prediction

Description
This project aims to predict the quality of wine based on various physicochemical properties. The objective is to build and evaluate machine learning models that can accurately classify wine quality.
The dataset used is the Wine Quality Dataset, which contains information on various physicochemical properties of wine and their corresponding quality ratings.
wine_code.ipynb: The main Jupyter notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and visualization.

Project Title
Breast Cancer Classification

Description
This project involves building and evaluating machine learning models for the classification of breast cancer. The objective is to classify whether a tumour is benign or malignant based on various features extracted from breast cancer cell images.
The dataset used in this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset, which contains features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. These features describe the characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.
